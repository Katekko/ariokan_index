# Page Test Instructions (Pointer)
Authoritative version: `memory/page_test_instructions.md`.

Summary:
- Idle golden required (`<feature>_page_idle`).
- Groups: Interfaces / Interactions.
- Register only needed mocks via `register()` at top-level.
- Use localized test app helper; avoid raw MaterialApp duplication.

Update only the memory file; keep this stub minimal.
