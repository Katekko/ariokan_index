# Copilot Instructions

## Reference: Non-Negotiable Memory
All contributors and agents must always review and comply with the non-negotiable rules in `.github/instructions/memory.instruction.md` before making any changes. These rules apply to all files and take precedence over other instructions.

## Constitution Lookup
Before making any changes that could conflict with existing specifications, always review the contents of [constitution](../.specify/memory/constitution.md). Ensure that your modifications are aligned with the guidelines and requirements described in these files. If so, you need to change the constitution.md first before making the changes.

## Dart/Flutter Documentation
If you have any question about the Dart / Flutter documentation, use the MCP/tool to see for yourself.

## Flutter Project Location
When talking about the Flutter project you can find the project in `./ariokan_index`.

## Test Creation
Never create tests that are not mirroring the existing files.
