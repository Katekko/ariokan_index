# Feature Specification: Login Screen

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-a-login`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create a login screen"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a prospective or returning user, I want to access my personal account area by providing valid credentials on a clearly presented login screen so that I can use personalized features of the product.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an unauthenticated user on first launching the application, **When** the user enters a valid username and password and submits, **Then** the system authenticates the user and routes to the Decks screen.
2. **Given** an unauthenticated user on the login screen, **When** the user submits with an empty username or password, **Then** the system blocks submission and shows inline validation indicating required fields.
3. **Given** an unauthenticated user on the login screen, **When** the user submits an incorrect username or password, **Then** the system displays the generic message "Username or password wrong" and preserves both entered values (password retained) for correction.
4. **Given** an authenticated user returning to the app with an existing session, **When** the app is launched, **Then** the user is taken directly to the Decks screen without seeing the login screen.
5. **Given** a user on the login screen who does not yet have an account, **When** they tap the sign-up action, **Then** they are routed to the sign-up screen.

### Edge Cases
- User submits with one or more required fields empty ‚Üí Show validation feedback and block submission.
- User submits credentials with leading/trailing spaces ‚Üí System trims whitespace before validation.
- Network connectivity lost during submission ‚Üí Show distinct network error (not the generic auth failure message) with a retry path.
- Reopening app after successful prior login (session not cleared) ‚Üí Skip login and go directly to Decks screen.
- Attempted automated rapid submissions ‚Üí No lockout; all attempts processed (noting potential future security enhancement).
- Accessibility considerations deferred in scope (explicitly excluded for this iteration; to be scheduled later).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST present a dedicated login screen to unauthenticated users attempting to access protected areas.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to input a username and password (email, phone, and other identifiers are out of scope).
- **FR-003**: System MUST locally validate that username and password fields are not empty before enabling submission.
- **FR-004**: System MUST trim leading and trailing whitespace from the username before authentication.
- **FR-005**: System MUST submit credentials for authentication only when both fields are non-empty.
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the generic failure message "Username or password wrong" for any invalid credential attempt.
- **FR-007**: System MUST keep both username and password fields populated after a failed attempt.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a visual loading indicator by converting the login button into a spinning/loading state during an in-progress authentication attempt and prevent duplicate submissions while loading.
- **FR-009**: System MUST route successful authentication directly to the Decks screen.
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist the authenticated session until explicit logout or local cache/session data is cleared (no automatic timeout in this iteration).
- **FR-011**: System MUST bypass the login screen on app relaunch if a valid session exists.
- **FR-012**: System MUST distinguish network errors from authentication failures with a different message (e.g., network error message not finalized here but distinct from generic auth failure).
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide a secondary-action control to navigate to the sign-up screen.
- **FR-014**: System MUST not include password recovery or reset options (explicitly excluded).
- **FR-015**: System MUST log (in development logs) each authentication attempt outcome (success/failure) without retention guarantees beyond current development environment.
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow unlimited authentication attempts (no lockout, rate limiting, or CAPTCHA in this iteration).
- **FR-017**: System MUST NOT expose which part (username vs password) was incorrect in failure messaging.
- **FR-018**: System MUST allow manual logout (logout function assumed outside scope of this screen but necessary for session reset reference).
- **FR-019**: System MUST ensure sign-up action is visually presented as secondary priority relative to the primary login action.
- **FR-020**: System MUST operate without explicit accessibility compliance enhancements in this iteration (future enhancement noted).

*Ambiguities intentionally marked to ensure clarification prior to implementation.*

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Credential Submission**: Represents a single authentication attempt; attributes: username (original + trimmed form), password (not persisted beyond transient submission), timestamp, outcome (success/failure), error type (network vs invalid credentials).
- **Session Context**: Represents a persistent authenticated state; attributes: user reference, creation timestamp, persistence flag (lifetime until logout/cache clear), last launch access timestamp.
