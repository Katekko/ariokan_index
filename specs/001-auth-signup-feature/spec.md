# Feature Specification: Auth Signup

**Feature Branch**: `001-auth-signup-feature`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "auth_signup feature: allow new users to register with unique username + password (firebase auth) capturing username (slug), email, password, storing user profile doc after account creation. Enforce username regex ^[a-z0-9_]{3,20}$ and uniqueness via usernames collection. Out of scope: social login, email verification, password reset."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an unauthenticated player, I want to create an account by choosing a unique username, providing my email and a password so that I can create and publish decks tied to my identity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an unauthenticated visitor on the signup form, **When** they enter a valid unused username (pattern-compliant), valid email, valid password, and submit, **Then** an account is created and they become authenticated and redirected to the app's next onboarding step (e.g., deck list or profile area).
2. **Given** an unauthenticated visitor, **When** they enter a username already reserved, **Then** the form rejects submission and shows a clear "username already taken" message without creating an account.
3. **Given** an unauthenticated visitor, **When** they enter a username violating the regex, **Then** the form displays validation errors and submission is disabled or rejected.
4. **Given** a network or backend failure during account creation, **Then** no partial reservation or profile record is created (atomic operation) and the username remains available.
5. **Given** a user who successfully signed up, **When** they revisit while authenticated, **Then** they should not see the signup form and are redirected to the deck list page.

### Edge Cases
- Username at minimum length (3 chars) and maximum length (20 chars) accepted if pattern-compliant.
- Username containing disallowed characters (uppercase letters, hyphens, spaces, symbols) rejected with specific guidance.
- Rapid double-submit (user clicks submit twice) should not create duplicate accounts or duplicate username reservations.
- Lost focus without submission should not reserve usernames permanently.
- Password minimal strength requirement: minimum length 6 characters (no additional complexity requirement).
- Email format invalid -> inline error; no backend attempt.
- Browser refresh mid-process should not leave any reserved username (nothing is written until full success).


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a new user to register using email, password, and a unique username.
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate username client-side and server-side against regex ^[a-z0-9_]{3,20}$.
 - **FR-003**: System MUST reject signup if username already exists in the username registry (central uniqueness store).
 - **FR-004**: System MUST apply an atomic creation: username registry entry and user profile record are only written after successful authentication and profile initialization; on any failure nothing is persisted.
 - **FR-005**: System MUST persist a user profile record containing at minimum: username, createdAt timestamp (UTC), and capacity for future metadata (fields may be added later without breaking existing data).
- **FR-006**: System MUST treat username as immutable post-creation (no updates in MVP) aligning with Firestore rules draft.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear inline validation errors for username, email format, and password requirements.
- **FR-008**: System MUST automatically authenticate (session established) immediately after successful signup.
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent duplicate submissions (idempotent behavior on rapid multi-click).
 - **FR-010**: System MUST prevent access to signup form for already authenticated users by redirecting them to the deck list page.
 - **FR-011**: System SHOULD log (console only) failed signup attempts with reason (validation vs backend) for developer diagnostics in MVP.
 - **FR-012**: System MUST not require email verification in MVP (explicitly out of scope) but must not block future addition.
- **FR-013**: System MUST NOT include social login providers in MVP.
- **FR-014**: System SHOULD surface generic error message for unexpected backend failures without leaking internal details.
 - **FR-015**: System MUST enforce password minimum length of 6 characters (no further complexity rules) and should allow up to 128 characters.
 - **FR-016**: System MUST treat a network failure after authentication but before profile record persistence as a failed signup: revert session (sign out) and present a retry option; no username registry entry is left behind.

*All previously ambiguous items have been resolved per decisions provided.*

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an account holder. Attributes (logical): username (immutable), email, createdAt, (future) profile fields. Relationships: has many decks.
 - **Username Reservation**: Logical concept represented by an entry in the username registry mapping username → userId; ensures uniqueness (only created atomically with full successful signup).
